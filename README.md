# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE 

## This project is to showcase a very simplistic developer portfolio website that contains:

- projects
- skills
- contact information

## Project Structure

This repository contains an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file as well as a src folder containing images and gifs. 

## How to run the site

The site has not been deployed so it should be run locally on each system by running a live session.
